    question:
      "What will be the monthly expenses (approx.) for a fresher including mess, stationary, and some other student expenses?",
    answer:
      "To get the exact fee structure (Academic + Mess) one can visit the home page of IITJ and check the fee under the academics section. The total (Academic + Mess) fee that a fresher needs to pay will vary according to the category to which one belongs and the monthly income of the household of the student (some concessions are provided if the household income is less than 5 LPA). Excluding fees, a few stationeries are required in the first semester which are available within the campus and cost around Rs 500-600. Other expenses vary from student to student.",

    question:
      "Whether we have to open the bank account there itself or can we open the account before reaching there also?",
    answer:
      "You can have your bank account from your hometown. But it is advisable to open an account in the IITJ SBI branch because that will be needed in future activities like filling scholarship forms, getting repayment of the fee, etc. Bank officials will be there on the reporting date to help in easing out the formalities for the students in opening a new bank account.",

    question: "How is the IIT Jodhpur campus life?",
    answer:
      "The permanent campus spans an area of 852 acres. Hostels are airy and spacious. Open cemented as well as grassy grounds are in every hostel. Mess, canteen, and fine dining, as well as all the academic buildings, are at walking distance from the hostels. Owing to the small strength of students at IIT Jodhpur, we live like a family here. Seniors and juniors have fostered healthy interaction. IIT Jodhpur has four fests: Spandan (Intra Cultural fest), Prometro (Intra Technical fest), Varchas (Inter Sports fest), and Ignus (Inter Socio-Cultural Techfest). We have many clubs and societies which provide a platform for students to learn and perform. It is ensured that everyone from all disciplines gets a chance to actively participate in the clubs and fests here.",
